# Messager-app-project
The following project is meant to resolve communication
problems, the people don’t have a communication alternative
to the phone calls that sometimes are difficult to take
depending the situation, also are restricted if the people need
to talk with different people at the same time principally
a digital solution. People have the need to communicate
remotely through the Internet in order to facilitate the
communication to investigation, politics, even in social
matters, Assuming that people have access to the Internet,
it will be a solution to this problem, previously the people
communicated but locally, with the people in the same red, the
first mail was sent with the CTSS [1] at Massachusetts, but
it was not an email properly, because it has some limitations
due to the incapacity to access the internet, considering that
there was a base to the solution for the need, at the moment
of writing this paper people have messager systems that
provide different options.
There are some previous solutions like Outlook, which
provides you with an email address that you can use to
communicate with your friends, family, coworkers, and even
people you don’t know for work and research purposes.
However, it has domains, which means that you, as a
company, can request to have your own domain currently
with some benefits. Line and Telegram are just messaging
applications that use a username and a password to access
your chats, keeping in mind that our goal is a messaging
application; the processes carried out are aligned to obtain an
application like Line, Telegram, or WhatsApp, mainly focused
on common messaging without any additional accreditation
like that of Outlook, which is used for many other things
beyond messaging, including registration on websites and
others.
This work was funded by Your Funding Source under grant No. 12345.
This solution will be based on the object oriented programming
[2], using the principles of OOP; the design phase gave
us a theoretical prototype with which we began the definition
of classes, attributes and the mookups. With this information
we considered the project to be what we wanted at least
theoretically, the challenges start at the application of the
theory we had in the first design, the first step was deciding
that we were using the oriented object programming, after that
we decided which classes are we using, keeping our focus in
mind and selecting only what was necessary; we decided to
keep a user class, a chat class, and a message class to have a
good organization at the chats without database management
